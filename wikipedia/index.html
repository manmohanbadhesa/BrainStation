    <span>
      A <strong>farm</strong> (also called an
      <a href="/">agricultural</a> holding) is an area of land that is devoted
      primarily to agricultural processes with the primary objective of
      producing food and other crops; it is the basic facility in food
      production.[1] The name is used for specialized units such as arable
      farms, vegetable farms, fruit farms, dairy, pig and poultry farms, and
      land used for the production of natural fiber, biofuel, and other
      commodities. It includes ranches, feedlots, orchards, plantations and
      estates, smallholdings, and hobby farms, and includes the farmhouse and
      agricultural buildings as well as the land. In modern times, the term has
      been extended so as to include such industrial operations as wind farms
      and fish farms, both of which can operate on land or at sea.

      <span
        >The word in the sense of an agricultural land-holding derives from the
        verb "to farm" a revenue source, whether taxes, customs, rents of a
        group of manors or simply to hold an individual manor by the feudal land
        tenure of "fee farm". The word is from the medieval Latin noun firma,
        also the source of the French word ferme, meaning a fixed agreement,
        contract,[3] from the classical Latin adjective firmus meaning strong,
        stout, firm.[4][5] As in the medieval age virtually all manors were
        engaged in the business of agriculture, which was their principal
        revenue source, so to hold a manor by the tenure of "fee farm" became
        synonymous with the practice of agriculture itself.</span
