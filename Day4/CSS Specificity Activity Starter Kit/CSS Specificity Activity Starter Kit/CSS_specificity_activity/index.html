    <h1>The History of CSS</h1>
    <p>
        HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!
    </p>
    <p>
        HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:
    <p class="example">
        <code id="heading-example">
            &lt;h3>This is a heading&lt;/h3>
        </code>
    </p>
    <p class="example">
        <code id="paragraph-example">
            &lt;p>This is a paragraph.&lt;/p>
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>
        When tags like &lt;font>, and color attributes were added to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html32">HTML 3.2 specification</a>, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.
    </p>
    <p>
        To solve this problem, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a> created CSS.
    </p>
    <p class= "lastparagraph">
        CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!
